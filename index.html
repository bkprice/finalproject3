        <h1>Why Have New York Law Enforcement Deaths Increased in the Last 10 Years? </h1>
        <p>With rising cases of police brutality across our country, does it correspond with police deaths?</p>

      <p>It’s no surprise that the reputation of police and law enforcement everywhere has diminished over the last few years. Events such as the George Floyd tragedy have ignited backlash and protests among those who were tired of the way police were treating them, and many have called for the defunding of law enforcement or even the abolition of police in general. Behind these protests and ideas is the concept that police are making situations worse or less safe when they get involved, and while this may be true in many ways, I would like to look at a different statistic and how it involves all of the recent controversies around police officers. 
</p>
        <p>While many focus on the number of people who have died at the hands of the police, few acknowledge the startling number of law enforcement deaths over the last 10 years in the state of New York, this is categorized as any member of New York State law enforcement who has died while on active duty. I think that while it’s important to hold law enforcement accountable for their actions and crimes, it’s also important to acknowledge the number of people that have sacrificed their lives while doing their job as police officers.
</p>
        <p>It should be noted that this data is a collection of all police departments throughout New York state, including those in New York City. Since the population of the city is so much larger than anywhere else in the state, the vast majority of these numbers come from the NYPD. I think this is important, however, because largely populated areas are where the vast majority of police altercation occurs. 
</p>
        <p>As stated previously, the amount of law enforcement deaths in the last 10 years has been a sharp increase from what we’ve seen in the past. The chart below it’s shown that each year since 2012 had more officer deaths than every other year besides 2001. 2001 should stand as an outlier of sorts, as the high number of 62 deaths is because of the 9/11 tragedy.

        <p>Nonetheless, more officers are dying in recent years than ever before. But why is that? Most would think that the recent backlash about police brutality would be indicative of hostility towards these officers, but in reality, most of these deaths took place before this controversy.

        <p>The tragic death of George Floyd sparked outrage among the public, resulting in discourse over topics such as racial justice and police brutality. After Floyd was murdered at the hands of an ignorant and horrible police officer, many began condemning them and what they stand for. Protests began and law enforcement received a bad reputation, the obvious theory would be that people were fed up with the police and began attacking them, resulting in more deaths among police officers. This is not the case, however. George Floyd passed away on May 25, 2020. In 2020 more police officers were killed in the state of New York before Floyd’s death (24) than after it (18). So if there’s no evidence linking the two, how is it that so many officers are getting killed?
</p>
        <p>First off, let’s take a look at where these killings are taking place. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of police deaths in the last 10 years have taken place in New York City. There are multiple agencies and departments that encompass the entire area of the city, but the main one is the NYPD. Even though most would assume that more officers are being killed in the city of New York than outside of it, the margin of difference between the two is startling.

</script>

        <p>Over 200 more officers have been killed in the NYPD in the last 10 years than all other officers combined across every other department in the state of New York. Nick Fridgio, a police officer in New York city, suggested that while these numbers may be startling, it’s only a product of the spanse of the city. “We’ve done a great job keeping this place safe over the years, but it’s a large place, you have to be willing to accept some variables and the fact that the city is changing all the time.” If that’s the case, maybe a different perspective is required to understand the reason for this anomaly. Perhaps this uptick in death isn’t correlated with crime or any social justic issue. New York city is a massive area, thousands of new people enter and exit the city every day. Some of them have good intentions and some have bad intentions, and there’s no way to predict or surmise why they behave the way they do. Officer Fridgio said that the city is always changing, and that’s something to listen to. This issue is something to keep an eye on for sure, but for now all we can do is draw conclusions.
